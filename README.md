A cool tool that utilizes the Caesar Cipher. If unaware of this concept, the Caesar Cipher, it is one of the most simplest shift ciphers that use the substitution of a letter by another one in the alphabet. Since there are a limited number of letters in the alphabet, this cipher can easily be cracked via a brute force system. Because of this, the encryption of sensitive data is not encouraged.
This project applies VS Code, Flask, pip, Python, and HTML.
